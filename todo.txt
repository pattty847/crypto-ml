Create a separate class to handle connection and trade watching for a single exchange, e.g., ExchangeWatcher. This class should have methods for starting and stopping the watching process and a callback mechanism for reporting new trades.

Create a separate class for managing multiple ExchangeWatcher instances, e.g., ExchangeWatchersManager. This class should provide methods to add and remove exchanges to be watched and handle the aggregation of trade data.

Modify the Window class to only handle the UI updates. It should receive updates from the ExchangeWatchersManager and update the UI accordingly.

Use asyncio.run() or asyncio.run_until_complete() in your main script to start the event loop and run the entire application.
